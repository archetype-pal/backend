"""The locked `data-dpt` ↔ TEI mapping (Phase H.1).

Grounded in the 25 distinct constructs that actually occur across the live
899-row corpus (not the generic roadmap table). Only `<span>` carries
`data-dpt`; every other element (`<p>`, `<em>`, `<a>`, plain `<span>`,
`<br>`) passes through untouched.

Design notes:
- `data-dpt-cat` is **derived** from the `data-dpt` value on the reverse
  trip (clause→words, everything else→chars), so it never needs separate
  storage. The lone `lb` with `cat="sep"` is the one exception and is carried
  on TEI as `@type="sep"`.
- `data-graph-id` (the text↔region link) is carried on TEI as
  `@corresp="#gid-N [#gid-M ...]"`, which round-trips multi-id spans.
- `lb` spans wrap a separator glyph in this corpus, so they are emitted as
  content-bearing `<lb>...</lb>` rather than empty milestones — fidelity over
  strict TEI purity at the converter layer (the ODD/validator decides schema
  shape later, in H.10).
