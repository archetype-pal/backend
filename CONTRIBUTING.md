# Contributing to Archetype
Thank you for your interest in contributing! ðŸŽ‰

## How to Contribute
We use Pull Requests and feature branches for contributions.  
Also make sure your commits follow [Conventional Commits specification](https://conventionalcommits.org).  
Most of the time you will want to have an issue -assigned to you- created first.

1. **Fork the repository** (skip if you're a member on the archetype organization)
2. **Create a new branch** (`git checkout -b feat-XXX/changes-describing-title`)
3. **Make your changes**
4. **Test your changes**
5. **Commit your changes** (`git commit -m 'feat: adding something here!'`)
6. **Push to your fork (or directly)** (`git push origin feat-XXX/changes-describing-title`)
7. **Open a Pull Request**

### Branch naming
the branch name should start with the [type of changes](https://medium.com/@noriller/docs-conventional-commits-feat-fix-refactor-which-is-which-531614fcb65a) (feature, fix, etc).

followed by the issue number for this PR, if it exists.

## Code Style
Backend code uses `pylint`, `black`, and `isort`.
